## Overview

Vaporwave landing page with intense neon colors and satirical 80s/90s nostalgia. Ideal for capas de álbuns, colagens digitais, anúncios experimentais, arte de internet. AI-ready template. Vaporwave emerged around 2010-2011 from the internet's underbelly — a bastard child of chopped-and-screwed muzak, dead mall aesthetics, and the collective hangover of late capitalism. Artists like Macintosh Plus and Floral Shoppe didn't just sample 80s smooth jazz and corporate elevator music — they weaponized it. The slowed-down, pitch-shifted loops became a mirror held up to consumer culture's empty promises, turning forgotten hold music into something genuinely haunting.

What makes vaporwave fascinating as a design movement is that it was never supposed to be one. It started as album art on Bandcamp — Roman busts, Windows 95 interfaces, Japanese text nobody could read, and that specific shade of pink-purple that now triggers instant recognition. The aesthetic spread because it filled a void: a visual language for digital alienation that was simultaneously ironic and sincere. You could laugh at the absurdity of a marble bust floating in a neon grid void while also feeling something real about the disposability of digital culture.

By 2015, the aesthetic had been absorbed into mainstream design — which is either its ultimate victory or its final irony, depending on how committed you are to the bit.
